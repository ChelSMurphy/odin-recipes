                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Shakshuka may be at the apex of eggs-for-dinner recipes, though in Israel is is a breakfast food, a bright, spicy start
                        to the day with a pile of pita or challah served on the site. It's a one-skillet recipe of eggs baked
                        in a tomato-red pepper sauce spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne.</p>
                    <p>First you make that sauce, which comes together fairly quickly on top of the stove, then you gently
                        crack each of the eggs into the pan, nestling them into the sauce. The pan is moved into the oven to finish.
                        Shakshuka originated in North Africa, and like many great dishes there are as many version as there
                        are cooks who havae embraced it. This one strays from more traditional renditions by adding crumbled
                        feta cheese, which softens into creamy nuggets in the oven's heat.</p>
